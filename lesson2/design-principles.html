    <p>This design allows the eye travel in an organized, 
        non-chaotic manner. Related words are grouped together, 
        and tied to other related words by the use of space and actual lines. 
        Information is beautifully organized by the use of intentional 
        white space.</p>

    <p>This design is very effective because it clean, and has only 
        necassary elements. For an interior designer's site, the design is 
        especially effective because it eliminates all complexity from the
        design, except for the photos; which allows the photos to really 
        stand out. Simple fonts are used, with quite a bit of white Space
        surrounding it in order to communicate a sense of peace and organization.

    <p>The use of similar, but different blocks defining different sectors
        of the site's organization is very clean and appealing to the eye.
        It lays out the site's structure in an understandable way for the user.
        Also the use of similar fonts, photo color grades, and interactive responses
        aid the site to come together as one through repitition.
